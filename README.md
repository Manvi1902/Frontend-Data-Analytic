## Data Analysis  

As part of this project, I performed analytics on the Indian Agriculture dataset, focusing on crop production metrics between 1950 and 2020. The analysis involved creating two key tables that summarize essential aspects of crop production over the years.   

### 1. Crop Production Table  

This table aggregates crop data with the following key metrics:  

- **Year**: The year for which the crop data is analyzed.  
- **Crop with Maximum Production**: The crop that exhibited the highest production for each year.  
- **Crop with Minimum Production**: The crop that had the lowest production in that year.  
- **Average Yield of the Crop** (1950-2020): The average yield of each crop across the entire dataset span.  
- **Average Cultivation Area of the Crop** (1950-2020): The average area cultivated for each crop during the same period.  

These metrics provide insights into trends in crop production, variations in yield, and how cultivation areas have changed over time.

### Technologies Used  

- **TypeScript**: For implementing type-safe code, enhancing readability and maintainability throughout the application.  
- **React**: The front-end framework used to build the user interface, allowing for a responsive and dynamic experience.  
- **Vite**: A build tool that offers an optimized development experience with fast hot module replacement and builds.  
- **Mantine v7**: A robust component library for React that provides a range of accessible and customizable UI components, streamlining the development process.  

This analysis, along with the visualization and aggregation of crop data, aids in understanding agricultural patterns and making informed decisions based on historical trends.
